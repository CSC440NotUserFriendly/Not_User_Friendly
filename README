Project Install Instructions -
	To install the project you need to create your own app engine connected android application and then manually add various source files to it in order to compile correctly.  
	This is not a trivial task and may require some additional steps based on your Eclipse version and plugins.  Upon request we can build and upload a demo to a device in lieu of these steps.
	Steps:
		1. In Eclipse->File->New->Other->App Engine Connected Android App
			a. Name "SMIL
			b. Package "csc440.nuf"
		2. Clone the repo
			a. ssh clone git@github.com:CSC440NotUserFriendly/Not_User_Friendly.git
		3. You will have two separate projects (SMIL-Android and SMIL-App Engine)
			a. On both projects copy the "src" folders from the repo to your Eclipse projects
			b. In SMIL-App Engine also copy the "shared" folder
			c. In SMIL-Android also copy the "res" folder and AndroidManifest.xml
		4. Once you clean the build you should have a working project.
			a. to run the project right click on the android project
			b. Select debug as->Local App Engine Connected Android Application
				i. This will create a local web server instance



Phase 1 deliverables:

All our documentation is contained in the Documents folder.
In the deliverables folder there are the following files:
	SRS.doc - Contains functional and non-functional requirements
	HighLevelFunctionalDia.pdf - System Diagram
	UserDiagram.pdf - User oriented flow diagram
	StatusUpdates - Folder containing weekly update information
	ScreenShots.pdf - Actual images of our GUI

In the root Documents folder there are the following documents:
	Agenda - Folder containing weekly objectives to be discussed
	Meeting Minutes - Our notes for each meeting (This is really just a combination of the Agenda and status updates)
	Schedule - MS Project with all our tasks
	Test Plan - Contains our test plan document

In the root project directory there is a SMILProject folder, this is our eclipse project.
You should be able to import this directly into eclipse.  We have classes for parsing the smile files, 
the objects and data structures for handling them, the player interface, and a sample presentation for testing.
