	HighLevelFunctionalDia.pdf - System Diagram
	UserDiagram.pdf - User oriented flow diagram
	StatusUpdates - Folder containing weekly update information
	ScreenShots.pdf - Actual images of our GUI

In the root Documents folder there are the following documents:
	Agenda - Folder containing weekly objectives to be discussed
	Meeting Minutes - Our notes for each meeting (This is really just a combination of the Agenda and status updates)
	Schedule - MS Project with all our tasks
	Test Plan - Contains our test plan document

In the root project directory there is a SMILProject folder, this is our eclipse project.
You should be able to import this directly into eclipse.  We have classes for parsing the smile files, 
the objects and data structures for handling them, the player interface, and a sample presentation for testing.
